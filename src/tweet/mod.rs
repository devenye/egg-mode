//! Structs and functions for working with statuses and timelines.
//!
//! In this module, you can find various structs and methods to load and interact with tweets and
//! their metadata. This also includes loading a user's timeline, posting a new tweet, or liking or
//! retweeting another tweet. However, this does *not* include searching for tweets; that
//! functionality is in the [`search`][] module.
//!
//! [`search`]: ../search/index.html
//!
//! ## Types
//!
//! - `Tweet`/`TweetEntities`/`ExtendedTweetEntities`: At the bottom of it all, this is the struct
//!   that represents a single tweet. The `*Entities` structs contain information about media,
//!   links, and hashtags within their parent tweet.
//! - `DraftTweet`: This is what you use to post a new tweet. At present, not all available options
//!   are supported, but basics like marking the tweet as a reply and attaching a location
//!   coordinate are available.
//! - `Timeline`: Returned by several functions in this module, this is how you cursor through a
//!   collection of tweets. See the struct-level documentation for details.
//!
//! ## Functions
//!
//! ### User actions
//!
//! These functions perform actions on their given tweets. They require write access to the
//! authenticated user's account.
//!
//! - `delete` (for creating a tweet, see `DraftTweet`)
//! - `like`/`unlike`
//! - `retweet`/`unretweet`
//!
//! ### Metadata lookup
//!
//! These functions either perform some direct lookup of specific tweets, or provide some metadata
//! about the given tweet in a direct (non-`Timeline`) fashion.
//!
//! - `show`
//! - `lookup`/`lookup_map` (for the differences between these functions, see their respective
//!   documentations.)
//! - `retweeters_of`
//! - `retweets_of`
//!
//! ### `Timeline` cursors
//!
//! These functions return `Timeline`s and can be cursored around in the same way. See the
//! documentation for `Timeline` to learn how to navigate these return values. This correspond to a
//! user's own view of Twitter, or with feeds you might see attached to a user's profile page.
//!
//! - `home_timeline`/`mentions_timeline`/`retweets_of_me`
//! - `user_timeline`/`liked_by`

///Represents a single status update.
///
///The fields present in this struct can be mainly split up based on the context they're present
///for.
///
///## Base Tweet Info
///
///This information is the basic information inherent to all tweets, regardless of context.
///
///* `text`
///* `id`
///* `created_at`
///* `user`
///* `source`
///* `favorite_count`/`retweet_count`
///* `lang`, though third-party clients usually don't surface this at a user-interface level.
///  Twitter Web uses this to create machine-translations of the tweet.
///* `coordinates`/`place`
///* `display_text_range`
///* `truncated`
///
///## Perspective-based data
///
///This information depends on the authenticated user who called the data. These are left as
///Options because certain contexts where the information is pulled either don't have an
///authenticated user to compare with, or don't have to opportunity to poll the user's interactions
///with the tweet.
///
///* `favorited`
///* `retweeted`
///* `current_user_retweet`
///
///## Replies
///
///This information is only present when the tweet in question is marked as being a reply to
///another tweet, or when it's threaded into a chain from the same user.
///
///* `in_reply_to_user_id`/`in_reply_to_screen_name`
///* `in_reply_to_status_id`
///
///## Retweets and Quote Tweets
///
///This information is only present when the tweet in question is a native retweet or is a "quote
///tweet" that references another tweet by linking to it. These fields allow you to reference the
///parent tweet without having to make another call to `show`.
///
///* `retweeted_status`
///* `quoted_status`/`quoted_status_id`
///
///## Media
///
///As a tweet can attach an image, GIF, or video, these fields allow you to access information
///about the attached media. Note that polls are not surfaced to the Public API at the time of this
///writing (2016-09-01). For more information about how to use attached media, see the
///documentation for [`MediaEntity`][].
///
///[`MediaEntity`]: ../entities/struct.MediaEntity.html
///
///* `entities` (note that this also contains information about hyperlinks, user mentions, and
///  hashtags in addition to a picture/thumbnail)
///* `extended_entities`: This field is only present for tweets with attached media, and houses
///  more complete media information, in the case of a photo set, video, or GIF. For videos and
///  GIFs, note that `entities` will only contain a thumbnail, and the actual video links will be
///  in this field. For tweets with more than one photo attached, `entities` will only contain the
///  first photo, and this field will contain all of them.

/// IDs.
///
/// Using a Timeline to navigate collections of tweets (like a user's timeline, their list of likes,
/// etc) allows you to efficiently cursor through a collection and only load in tweets you need.
///
/// To begin, call a method that returns a `Timeline`, optionally set the page size, and call
/// `start` to load the first page of results:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # let con_token = egg_mode::Token::new("", "");
/// # let access_token = egg_mode::Token::new("", "");
/// let mut timeline = egg_mode::tweet::home_timeline(&con_token, &access_token)
///                                .with_page_size(10);
///
/// for tweet in &timeline.start().unwrap().response {
///     println!("<@{}> {}", tweet.user.screen_name, tweet.text);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If you need to load the next set of tweets, call `older`, which will automatically update the
/// tweet IDs it tracks:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # let con_token = egg_mode::Token::new("", "");
/// # let access_token = egg_mode::Token::new("", "");
/// # let mut timeline = egg_mode::tweet::home_timeline(&con_token, &access_token);
/// # timeline.start().unwrap();
/// for tweet in &timeline.older(None).unwrap().response {
///     println!("<@{}> {}", tweet.user.screen_name, tweet.text);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ...and similarly for `newer`, which operates in a similar fashion.
///
/// If you want to start afresh and reload the newest set of tweets again, you can call `start`
/// again, which will clear the tracked tweet IDs before loading the newest set of tweets. However,
/// if you've been storing these tweets as you go, and already know the newest tweet ID you have on
/// hand, you can load only those tweets you need like this:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # let con_token = egg_mode::Token::new("", "");
/// # let access_token = egg_mode::Token::new("", "");
/// let mut timeline = egg_mode::tweet::home_timeline(&con_token, &access_token)
///                                .with_page_size(10);
///
/// timeline.start().unwrap();
///
/// //keep the max_id for later
/// let reload_id = timeline.max_id.unwrap();
///
/// //simulate scrolling down a little bit
/// timeline.older(None).unwrap();
/// timeline.older(None).unwrap();
///
/// //reload the timeline with only what's new
/// timeline.reset();
/// timeline.older(Some(reload_id)).unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// Here, the argument to `older` means "older than what I just returned, but newer than the given
/// ID". Since we cleared the tracked IDs with `reset`, that turns into "the newest tweets
/// available that were posted after the given ID". The earlier invocations of `older` with `None`
/// do not place a bound on the tweets it loads. `newer` operates in a similar fashion with its
/// argument, saying "newer than what I just returned, but not newer than this given ID". When
/// called like this, it's possible for these methods to return nothing, which will also clear the
/// `Timeline`'s tracked IDs.
///
/// If you want to manually pull tweets between certain IDs, the baseline `call` function can do
/// that for you. Keep in mind, though, that `call` doesn't update the `min_id` or `max_id` fields,
/// so you'll have to set those yourself if you want to follow up with `older` or `newer`.
